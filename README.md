# ArtificialLife

It was a project for my university.
There are artificial life forms that live in a 2D space.
They are made of four lines, connected by joints.
Each joint is driven by a neural network.
The goal of the this projet was to create an organism,
that can move from point A to point B. 
The neural networks in the joints were trained using  genetic algorithm

It was forked from my private github account, where I use my nickname (jenczuen).
